Conclusion:
The Support Vector Machines (SVM) model performs the best among the compared algorithms,
achieving the highest accuracy of 69.51%. Random Forests also demonstrate competitive performance
with an accuracy of 67.99%. Additionally, both Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and XGBoost models
exhibit promising accuracy rates of 65.85% and 65.55%, respectively. These models also demonstrate
lower mean absolute error and root mean squared error compared to Decision Trees, suggesting better
predictive performance.

Therefore, for this dataset, SVM and Random Forests appear to be the most promising algorithms for
predicting water potability, followed closely by GBM and XGBoost.
